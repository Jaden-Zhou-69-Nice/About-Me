    <h1> My History </h1>
    <p> Age 0: Was born, parents wanted girl but got me ;-;. </p>
    <p> Age 1: Traveled to China to stay with Grandpa for 2-3 months. Most emotionally traumatic part of my one-year-old life.</p>
    <p> Age 2: No idea what happened here, to be honest. </p>
    <p> Age 3: Started preschool, got yelled at for coloring outside the lines for a drawing, met some of my friends. </p>
    <p> Age 4: Got the wrong toy at McDonald's, became an alcoholic. </p>
    <p> Age 5: Finally started remembering things better, went to China over the Summer of '12 and went to a ton of places with brother. </p>
    <p> Age 6: Started first grade, best teacher ever (thanks Ms. Durbin), got bullied and cheated out of $8.00, though this bully eventually apologized thanks to my mom. </p>
    <p> Age 7: Started second grade, got put in a combo class. Moved houses so my brother could go to Homestead High School. </p>
    <p> Age 8: Moved from Stocklmeir Elementary to West Valley Elementary, made some friends who bully me nowadays. </p>
    <p> Age 9: Pretty much the worst year of my life, terrible and sexist teacher, friend claims I 'bullied' him, he bullies me nowadays (f*ck you Bryan). </p>
    <p> Age 10: Started fifth grade, amazing year and got to know lots of more people. Trips to Serra Park, Walden West, and Golfland with grade. Best. Teacher. Ever. </p>
    <p> Age 11: 6th grade, a confusing year. Didn't do anything fun, decent teachers, auditioned and made A-Band </p>
    <p> Age 12: What I am right now. Entered 7th grade, pretty bad year, emotionally (I don't like to talk about it), went to Disneyland to perform with my A-Band group though </p>
    <p> Age 13: Don't know, but I'm boutta turn 13 in 3 weeks :D </p>
