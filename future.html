    <h2> College Plan </h2>
    <p> I hope I get into a good college (which basically means anything except De Anza College because if I go to De Anza, then my parents are gonna disown me). </p>

    <h2> Majors n Stuff </h2>
    <p> I know that I'm going to do a minor in music (my parents, again, would disown me if I chose music as my major), and I don't know what to do with my major yet, though. </p>
